description = This instrument collects a small surface sample and determines its exact mineral composition through powder X-Ray diffraction. Because Kerbals don't trust what they can't see the chamber has been filled with a special scintillation gas to allow for easy visibility of the X-Ray beam. The drill must contact the surface to obtain a usable sample; perform adequate tests before launch!
