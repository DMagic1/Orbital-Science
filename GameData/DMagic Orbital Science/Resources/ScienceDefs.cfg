	{
	default = Now this looks interesting.
	default = How could this have ended up here?

	KerbinSrfLandedKSC = It's the KSC!
	KerbinSrfLandedIslandAirfield = This appears to be an underused airfield, possibly built as an emergency landing site for launches from the KSC.
	KerbinSrfLandedKSC2 = This appears to be some kind of prototype launch facility, possibly used for training or as an early test location.	
	KerbinSrfLandedMonolith1 = Rumor is that Jeb found one of these black monoliths on the Mun and actually touched it. Could that be responsible for his unwavering (some would say foolish) bravery in the face of stupefying odds?
	KerbinSrfLandedMonolith2 = Getting a closer look at this odd black slate may prove difficult given the steep terrain where it is located.	
	KerbinSrfLandedMonolith3 = This monolith seems somehow alien to Kerbin, as if it were placed here by some unseen force.

	KerbinSrfLandedPyramids = These desert pyramids are one of the few examples of pre-spaceflight, surface-level Kerbal architecture.
	KerbinFlyingLowKSC = It's the KSC, from the air!
	KerbinFlyingLowIslandAirfield = From the air this looks like a nice spot for a landing; a useful alternative to the KSC airstrip.
	KerbinFlyingLowKSC2 = From the air this facility really pales in comparison with the KSC; it is lacking in various important buildings and likely provides only the bare minimum of services required for a launch.
	KerbinFlyingLowMonolith1 = A sharp spike in radio wave emissions is detected after making a close flyby over this object.
	KerbinFlyingLowMonolith2 = Nestled into the mountainside is another one of the strange black monoliths that have been reported at various locations on the surface of Kerbin.

	BopSrfLandedDeadKraken = The initial visual observation is difficult to believe at first glance. Signs of extraterrestrial biological life? An explanation for the unseen, lurking menace felt by all Kerbalnauts? Some kind of elaborate hoax? Closer study is warranted...
	BopSrfLandedDeadKraken = The round cleft (a mouth of some kind?) glows brightly in a wide swath of the electromagnetic spectrum. One can only hope that nothing will ever pry open that menacing cavity.
