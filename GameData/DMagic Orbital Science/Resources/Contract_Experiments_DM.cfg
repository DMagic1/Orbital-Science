		generic = The scientists at [0] have recently come to the realization that we know very little about [2]. To remedy this they have tasked you with studying this celestial body using a [3] to collect [1] data.
		
		generic = Recent advances made by [0] scientists have called into question several commonly held beliefs about [2]. By collecting [1] data directly from [2] using a [3] they could further advance our understanding of this celestial body.
		
		generic = Using a [3], the scientists at [0] would like you to take a spacecraft to [2] and collect [1] data there. They are willing to reward you handsomely for such a task and to provide some initial Funds for your use. 
		
		generic = A lucrative offer is being made by [0] for the further scientific study of [2]. Using a [3] they want you to collect [1] data and send it back to Kerbin for further study. Generous rewards and initial funding are being offered.

		
//{0} Agent name ; {1} Survey type  ; {2} Celestial Body name

		survey = The [0] group is planning a flagship mission to study [2]. They would like you to design, create and launch a spacecraft capable of conducting various [1] scientific observations. A generous up-front payment will be made to help finance this mission and a payout will be received upon successful delivery of the scientific data.
		
		survey = You have been given a proposal for a survey mission plan conceived by the scientists at [0]. They request that you collect various [1] scientific observations while at [2]. Funding will be provided along with a payment for any scientific data collected and returned to the [0] agency.
		
		survey = Noting a distinct lack of information about [2] the scientists at [0] have begun planning a mission to gather several scientific observations. They have tasked you with designing a spacecraft capable of reaching [2] and conducting various scientific experiments. Funds will be provided to help begin this mission and rewards will be given for any data recovered from [2]		 

	
//{0} Agent name ; {1} Celestial Body name

		biological = An exciting new proposal from [0] tasks you with designing and carrying out a mission to study [1] for any signs of current or past biological activity. Funds will be provided to purchase the necessary scientific instruments needed to carry out this survey, and payment will be rewarded upon receipt of the results.

		biological = Recent observations from Kerbin have raised the possibility that [1] may have once supported simple forms of organic life. The scientists at [0] have asked you to plan and carry out a mission to study [1] using a variety of scientific instruments designed to determine if there are any signs of past biological activity. The successful recovery of scientific results from this mission will be of great value to [0] and you will be rewarded accordingly.

		biological = Scientists on Kerbin have long postulated that [1] may have once been capable of harboring life. Now [0] has proposed a mission to study [1] by collecting several scientific observations; results from this mission will be analyzed closely and will certainly shed more light on [1]'s history and any potential life that it may have supported.
	
//[0] Agent name ; [1] Asteroid Name
		
		asteroid = Astronomers have recently discovered several previously unknown asteroids which may be passing close by Kerbin soon. The scientists at [0] have asked you to design a research vessel and send it to rendezvous with a [1] asteroid. Once there collect several scientific observations and return them to Kerbin for further study.
		
		asteroid = Experts at [0] have been closely following the trajectory of several [1] asteroids. They believe these may contain valuable resources and would like you to design and carry out a mission to study one of these asteroids to help get a better idea of its exact composition and nature.
		
		asteroid = An exciting new discovery has been made of a number of asteroids on a course that will bring them very close to Kerbin. The administrators at [0] want to take advantage of this opportunity and have asked you to design a research vessel and send it on a rendezvous mission to study a [1] asteroid. Recover several scientific observations and transmit the results back to Kerbin for further analysis. Funds will be provided to help get the mission started, and you will be compensated for any successfully recovered results.
		
//[0] Agent name ; [1] Celestial Body Name	
		
		anomaly = A number of odd readings have been detected coming from [1] in recent observations. Scientists from [0] are asking you to prepare a mission to [1] to study, and perhaps find the source of these strange readings. Advance funds will be provided and you will be rewarded for any data you send back to Kerbin. Results from a number of different scientific instruments may allow [0] scientists and engineers to better understand what is going on out there.
		
		anomaly = Curious reports about a mysterious signal coming from [1] have piqued the interest of [0]. To help shed some light on this issue they have asked you to design and carry out a mission to study and characterize this signal. If possible locate the source of these emissions and send back any data you can gather. You will be compensated for any useful data recovered from close proximity to the signal's source.
		
		anomaly = You have been sent an encoded message from a possibly deranged scientist claiming to work for [0]. This individual believes that a mysterious signal is emanating from [1] and that mainstream organizations are conspiring to cover it up. You have been asked to send a research vessel to study this signal and, if possible, locate its origin. Funds have been obtained to get the mission off the ground. The scientist promises to publicly release the results from any data you collect and to reward you for such data.

		magnetic = In an effort to further characterize [1] and to better understand the workings of solar and planetary magnetic fields, you have been asked to carry out a long term mission to [1]. Using a vessel equipped with magnetic and radio plasma wave instruments place a vessel in the specified orbit around [1]. Upon completion of the mission you will be rewarded with further funding.

		magnetic = Scientists at [0] have been studying [1] for some time now and wish to know more about its magnetic environment. They have given you a mission plan to launch a vessel to [1] carrying several instruments designed to study the magnetosphere during a long-term orbit.
