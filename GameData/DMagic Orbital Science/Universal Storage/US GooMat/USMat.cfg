description = The US-SC-9001 is a cutting edge, self contained laboratory. Have you ever wondered what happens to something in zero G? Or, have you ever pondered the truly meaningful questions? Such as what would happen if I exposed this to the rigors of stellar radiation and an unforgiving vacuum? Comes with complimentary notepad. Recommended for ages 4-8. Small parts inside make it not suitable for small children.
