description = The ASERT is an asteroid-only experiment used to study the interior composition of asteroids. It must be paired with a second module placed on the opposite side of an asteroid. When two modules are properly positioned the experiment can be conducted with the science amount dependent on how much of the asteroid the signal passed through.
