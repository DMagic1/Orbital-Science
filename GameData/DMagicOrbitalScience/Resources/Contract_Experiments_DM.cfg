//{0} Agent name ; {1} Survey type  ; {2} Celestial Body name
		survey = The [0] group is planning a flagship mission to study [2]. They would like you to design, create and launch a spacecraft capable of conducting various [1] scientific observations. A generous up-front payment will be made to help finance this mission and a payout will be received upon successful delivery of the scientific data.		
		survey = You have been given a proposal for a survey mission plan conceived by the scientists at [0]. They request that you collect various [1] scientific observations while at [2]. Funding will be provided along with a payment for any scientific data collected and returned to the [0] agency.		
		survey = Noting a distinct lack of information about [2] the scientists at [0] have begun planning a mission to gather several scientific observations. They have tasked you with designing a spacecraft capable of reaching [2] and conducting various scientific experiments. Funds will be provided to help begin this mission and rewards will be given for any data recovered from [2].	
//[0] Agent name ; [1] Asteroid Name		
		asteroid = Astronomers have recently discovered several previously unknown asteroids which may be passing close by Kerbin soon. The scientists at [0] have asked you to design a research vessel and send it to rendezvous with a [1] asteroid. Once there collect several scientific observations and return them to Kerbin for further study.		
		asteroid = Experts at [0] have been closely following the trajectory of several [1] asteroids. They believe these may contain valuable resources and would like you to design and carry out a mission to study one of these asteroids to help get a better idea of its exact composition and nature.		
		asteroid = An exciting new discovery has been made of a number of asteroids on a course that will bring them very close to Kerbin. The administrators at [0] want to take advantage of this opportunity and have asked you to design a research vessel and send it on a rendezvous mission to study a [1] asteroid. Recover several scientific observations and transmit the results back to Kerbin for further analysis. Funds will be provided to help get the mission started, and you will be compensated for any successfully recovered results.		
//[0] Agent name ; [1] Celestial Body Name		
		anomaly = A number of odd readings have been detected coming from [1] in recent observations. Scientists from [0] are asking you to prepare a mission to [1] to study, and perhaps find the source of these strange readings. Advance funds will be provided and you will be rewarded for any data you send back to Kerbin. Results from a number of different scientific instruments may allow [0] scientists and engineers to better understand what is going on out there.		
		anomaly = Curious reports about a mysterious signal coming from [1] have piqued the interest of [0]. To help shed some light on this issue they have asked you to design and carry out a mission to study and characterize this signal. If possible locate the source of these emissions and send back any data you can gather. You will be compensated for any useful data recovered from close proximity to the signal's source.		
		anomaly = You have been sent an encoded message from a possibly deranged scientist claiming to work for [0]. This individual believes that a mysterious signal is emanating from [1] and that mainstream organizations are conspiring to cover it up. You have been asked to send a research vessel to study this signal and, if possible, locate its origin. Funds have been obtained to get the mission off the ground. The scientist promises to publicly release the results from any data you collect and to reward you for such data.		
//[0] Agent name ; [1] Celestial Body Name ; [2] Time Needed (in seconds)		
		magnetic = In an effort to further characterize [1] and to better understand the workings of solar and planetary magnetic fields, you have been asked to carry out a long term mission to [1]. Using a vessel equipped with magnetic and radio plasma wave instruments place a vessel in the specified orbit around [1]. Upon completion of the mission you will be rewarded with further funding.
		magnetic = Scientists at [0] have been studying [1] for some time now and wish to know more about its magnetic environment. They have given you a mission plan to launch a vessel to [1] carrying several instruments designed to study the magnetosphere during a long-term orbit.
