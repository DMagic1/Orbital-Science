	DunaFlyingLowFace = Viewed from above the significance of this rock becomes obvious. There is no way to ignore the close resemblance to a Kerbal face.
	DunaFlyingLowMastCamera = What appears to be some kind of spacecraft instrument is jutting out of the surface here. Signs of more buried below?
	DunaFlyingLowPyramid = The precise geometry of this structure becomes more apparent when viewed from above.
	DunaFlyingLowPyramid = Perhaps the radio signals emanating from this structure contain some clue as to its origin.
	VallSrfLandedIcehenge = Visual observation shows what can't possibly be a natural phenomenon; the pattern of arrangement suggests some kind of intelligence at work.
	VallSrfLandedIcehenge = Bursts of powerful, repeating radio emissions are detected coming from these structures.
	VallFlyingLowIcehenge = The seemingly careful arrangement of these structures suggests some deeper meaning or purpose; perhaps a message of some kind?
	VallFlyingLowIcehenge = Powerful bursts of radio wave activity are detected while flying over this formation. Could this be some kind of transmitter or relay device?
	TyloSrfLandedCave = The cave looks rather cozy, almost like it's inviting you in to get comfortable and maybe stay a little while...
	TyloSrfLandedCave = When approaching this formation all of the background radio noise begins to die out, as if something is actively blocking it.
	TyloSrfLandedFace = Strong electromagnetic emissions are detected in this area, but nothing out of the ordinary is visible through the optical scanner.
	TyloFlyingLowCave = Upon visual inspection this appears to be nothing but an ordinary rock formation.
	TyloFlyingLowCave = While making a pass over the cave, all radio emissions seem to drop to zero, curious given Jool's normally high levels of background radio noise.
	TyloFlyingLowFace = The faint outlines of some kind of face-like object are visible on the surface here. Curiously, it doesn't seem to bear much resemblance to Kerbal faces.
	BopSrfLandedDeadKraken = The initial visual observation is difficult to believe at first glance. Signs of extraterrestrial biological life? An explanation for the unseen, lurking menace felt by all Kerbalnauts? Some kind of elaborate hoax? Closer study is warranted...
	BopSrfLandedDeadKraken = The round cleft (a mouth of some kind?) glows brightly in a wide swath of the electromagnetic spectrum. One can only hope that nothing will ever pry open that menacing cavity.
	BobFlyingLowDeadKraken = Observations show what can only be described as some kind of kraken, a Space Kraken if you will, lying on the surface of Bop. Dead, one can only hope...
	BopFlyingLowDeadKraken = Significant emissions of UV and X-ray radiation are detected. Observe caution when making any closer approaches to the entity.
