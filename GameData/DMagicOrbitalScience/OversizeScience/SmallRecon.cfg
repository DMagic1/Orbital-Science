manufacturer = DMagic
description = This single-camera surveillance telescope features a continuously panning aperture that covers 110 degree bands of the surface. This model features two non-reusable film cannisters and has limited on-board processing capabilities. Use for obtaining detailed photos of the surface or spotting any unusual features. Can be used at up to five times the normal low orbit altitude.
