description = A grossly oversized radio signals intelligence dish that can be used for listening in to every imaginable from of communication, discovering radio anomalies on a planet's surface, or just impressing your neighbor. Warning: Dish is FRAGILE it is NOT for use in the atmosphere! Can be used at up to five times the normal low orbit altitude.
